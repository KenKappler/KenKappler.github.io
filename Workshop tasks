Build a rock, paper, scissors contract where two users submit their throw (sequentially) along with a deposit, and in the next round reveal their answers to one another(or forfeit their deposits). Winner takes both deposits.

Hint 1: Create functions to start a game, submit a throw, reveal a throw, collect a deposit if 

Hint 2: Throws are submitted hashed with a random salt only known to the thrower, in the second stage thrower reveal their throw and their salt.

Hint 3: the contract should have a time limit so that failure to reveal your throw is counted as a loss.

Create three voting contracts for binary choices (ie: vote for a or b):
	First contract: Anyonce can vote - you vote using ether, Those who vote for the winning proposition receive a proportional share of the ether sent by those who backed the losing proposition.
	Second contract: List of participants decided during initialization, voters have an initial weighting to their vote; each time you vote for a winning proposition your Weighting decreases.
	Third contract: List of participants decided during initialization, voters have an initial weighting to their vote; each time you vote for a winning proposition your Weighting Increases.

Hint 1: for the first contract look to the previously examined crowd funding contract for ideas.

Build a contract which allows you to post text and timestamp it. For eternity.
