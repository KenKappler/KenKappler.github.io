	This tutorial will cover using the ethereum networks to store general information on the ethereum blockchain.

Bitcoin is essentially a transaction ledger secured by a consensus mechanism where transactions are considered to have occured if they have been validated by the majority of miners and a sufficient amount of work has gone into generating the blockchain they are located on. 

Ethereum provides the same functionality for autonomous contracts and their contract states. While this makes it very easy to write financial contracts built around transactions - ocassionally the only goal will be to store information on the blockchain.

I'll be looking at three different dapps, the first is a name registration app - similar to a domian registration service; A proof of existence dapp - which takes the hash of a piece of data outside the network and timestamps it on the blockchain; and finally a complex Graffiti Dapp - which uses lossless compression to store information in a contracts storage.

You'll see that all three of these cases the contracts are very simple and similar. The majority of the coding is constructed in the front end
