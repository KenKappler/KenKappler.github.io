		<p>This tutorial will cover using the ethereum networks to store general information on the ethereum blockchain.</p>
		<p>Bitcoin is essentially a transaction ledger secured by a consensus mechanism where transactions are considered to have occured if they have been validated by the majority of miners and a sufficient amount of work has gone into generating the blockchain they are located on.</p>
		<p>Ethereum provides the same functionality for autonomous contracts and their contract states. While this makes it very easy to write financial contracts built around transactions - ocassionally the only goal will be to store information on the blockchain.</p>
		<p>I'll be looking at three different dapps, the first is a name registration app - similar to a domian registration service; A proof of existence dapp - which takes the hash of a piece of data outside the network and timestamps it on the blockchain; and finally a complex Graffiti Dapp - which uses lossless compression to store information in a contracts storage.</p>
		<p>You'll see that all three of these cases the contracts are very simple and similar. The majority of the coding is constructed in the front end</p>
