Solidity has several tools to for you to structure the storage of a contract as a relational databse model. In the previous contract you used a mapping to store value associated with an address

In this tutorial we will cover the basic use of Structs, Arrays and mappings which abstract the creation of complex rules for storing information.

Firstly structs may be familiar to anyone who has used C type language before - essentially they are physical grouping of variables, stored under one reference:

struct coinWallet {
    uint redCoin;
    uint greenCoin;
  }

This defines a 'type' of struct but does not initialize an instance of it - this means that defining the struct doesnt write anything to the contracts storage, in order to do this we have to declare an instance of the struct *and* then assign values to its associcated variable:

coinWallet myWallet;
myWallet.redCoin = 500
myWallet.greenCoin = 250

this writes to storage addresses 0 and 1 respectively

contract Test{
	struct coinWallet {
    	uint redCoin;
    	uint greenCoin;
    }
	function Test(){
		coinWallet myWallet;
		myWallet.redCoin = 500;
		myWallet.greenCoin = 250;
	}
}



contract Coin {
	address minter;
	mapping (address => uint) balances;
	function Coin() {
		minter = msg.sender;
	}
	function mint(address owner, uint amount) {
		if (msg.sender != minter) return;
		balances[owner] += amount;
	}
	function send(address receiver, uint amount) {
		if (balances[msg.sender] < amount) return;
		balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
		balances[receiver] += amount;
	}
	function queryBalance(address addr) constant returns (uint balance) {
		return balances[addr];
	}
}
