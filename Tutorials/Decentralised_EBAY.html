	decentralized Ebay
	
	In this tutorial we will discuss a few new ideas, namely calculating hashes in contracts and simple verification of activities outside the blockchain.
	
	Our tutorial starts with a scenario: Alice has a guitar for sale and Bob is looking to buy a guitar - right now Alice will likely list her guitar on ebay and bob will see it, bid for it and if he wins - send the payment along with the 
	
	data Auction[2^80](deadline, highestBid, highestBidder, recipient)
	
	def startAuction(id, timeLimit):
		self.Auction[id].deadline = block.number + timeLimit
		self.Auction[id].recipient = msg.sender
	
	def bid(id):
		if self.Auction[id].highestBid + 1*10^18 <= msg.value and block.number < self.Auction[id].deadline:
			send(self.Auction[id].highestBidder, self.Auction[id].highestBid)
			self.Auction[id].highestBid = msg.value
			self.Auction[id].highestBidder = msg.sender
			return(1)
		else:
			send(msg.sender, msg.value)
			return(0)
	
	def endAuction(id):
		if block.number > self.Auction[id].deadline:
			self.Auction[id].deadline = 0
			self.Auction[id].recipient = 0
			send(self.Auction[id].recipient, self.Auction[id].highestBid)
			self.Auction[id].highestBid = 0
			self.Auction[id].highestBidder = 0
			return(1)
	
	This should look familiar to anyone who has completed the crowdfund contract - the contract is built to handle ether payments and deal with timelimits for the purpose of an auction.
	
	This is the simplest case - bidders send the maximum amount they wish to bid to the contract and once the time limit is up the seller can collect their winnings. However, In the case of Alice and Bob we have not included any protection for Bob to ensure that Alice actually delivers the Guitar. For this to happen the contract will need to act as an escrow account holding the ether as a third party until one of two things happen - Alice delivers the Guitar or a timelimit runs out.
	
	We will amend our contract so that when bidding Bob must also send the has of a random number known only to him. The contract will, once the acution ends, hold the ether until it receives a transaction from someone (presumably Alice or her Proxy) sends it the correct random number - At which point it sends the Ether to Alice. If the contract does not receive the Key within the alloted time the contract is voided and the ether is returned to Bob.
	
	How this would work in the real world is that Alice might hire a courier firm to deliver to Bob the Guitar - under instructions to only hand over the Guitar once Bob has given them the key which fulfils SHA256(key) = HASH. Once they have this key they may send a transaction to the blockchain themselves or have Alice do it, to release the ether.
	
	The new contract is here:
	
	data Auction[2^80](deadline, highestBid, highestBidder, highestHASH, recipient)
	
	def startAuction(id, timeLimit):
		self.Auction[id].deadline = block.number + timeLimit
		self.Auction[id].recipient = msg.sender
	
	def bid(id, hash):
		if self.Auction[id].highestBid + 1*10^18 <= msg.value and block.number < self.Auction[id].deadline:
			send(self.Auction[id].highestBidder, self.Auction[id].highestBid)
			self.Auction[id].highestBid = msg.value
			self.Auction[id].highestBidder = msg.sender
			self.Auction[id].highestHASH = hash
			return(1)
		else:
			send(msg.sender, msg.value)
			return(0)
	
	def endAuction(id, key):
		if block.number > self.Auction[id].deadline:
			if sha3(key) == self.Auction[id].highestHASH:
				self.Auction[id].deadline = 0
				self.Auction[id].recipient = 0
				self.auction[id].highestHASH = 0
				send(self.Auction[id].recipient, self.Auction[id].highestBid)
				self.Auction[id].highestBid = 0
				self.Auction[id].highestBidder = 0
				return(1)
	
	This concept of waiting for an event to occur before revealing a secret key is a powerful one - we will learn more about this in later tutorials. It is possible to build a similar contract where we use a message from Bob to release the funds in escrow to Alice - however this has the disadvantage of needing Bob to send the transaction.

	Alice knows that she wants to courier the Guitar to the eventual winner so she adds a third party to the contract:

	data Auction[2^80](deadline, highestBid, highestBidder, highestHASH, recipient, thirdParty, thirdPartyFee)
	
	def startAuction(id, timeLimit, thirdParty, thirdPartyFee):
		self.Auction[id].deadline = block.number + timeLimit
		self.Auction[id].recipient = msg.sender
		self.Auction[id].thirdParty = thirdParty
		self.Auction[id].thirdPartyFee = thirdPartyFee
	
	def bid(id, hash):
		if self.Auction[id].highestBid + 1*10^18 <= msg.value and block.number < self.Auction[id].deadline:
			send(self.Auction[id].highestBidder, self.Auction[id].highestBid)
			self.Auction[id].highestBid = msg.value
			self.Auction[id].highestBidder = msg.sender
			self.Auction[id].highestHASH = hash
			return(1)
		else:
			send(msg.sender, msg.value)
			return(0)
	
	def endAuction(id, key):
		if block.number > self.Auction[id].deadline:
			if sha3(key) == self.Auction[id].highestHASH:
				self.Auction[id].deadline = 0
				self.Auction[id].recipient = 0
				self.auction[id].highestHASH = 0
				send(self.Auction[id].recipient, self.Auction[id].highestBid - thirdPartyFee)
				send(self.Auction[id].thirdParty, self.Auction[id].thirdPartyFee)
				self.Auction[id].highestBid = 0
				self.Auction[id].highestBidder = 0
				return(1)

	This third party is a Courier service who receives it's fee from the contract the same way that Alice does - by retrieving the secret from Bob. It will only complete delivery when Bob hands over the correct secret key.

	There remains one problem with our contract - what if Alice changes her mind and decides not to send her Guitar to Bob. Bob's money would currently be trapped for ever, so we need to setup the event with a time limit so that if Bob's secret is not revealed within this time limit, he can reclaim his ether.

	data Auction[2^80](deadline, highestBid, highestBidder, highestHASH, recipient, thirdParty, thirdPartyFee, deliveryDeadline)
	
	def startAuction(id, timeLimit, thirdParty, thirdPartyFee, deliveryTimeLimit):
		self.Auction[id].deadline = block.number + timeLimit
		self.Auction[id].recipient = msg.sender
		self.Auction[id].thirdParty = thirdParty
		self.Auction[id].thirdPartyFee = thirdPartyFee
		self.Auction[id].deliveryDeadline = block.number + timeLimit + deliveryTimeLimit
	
	def bid(id, hash):
		if self.Auction[id].highestBid + 1*10^18 <= msg.value and block.number < self.Auction[id].deadline:
			send(self.Auction[id].highestBidder, self.Auction[id].highestBid)
			self.Auction[id].highestBid = msg.value
			self.Auction[id].highestBidder = msg.sender
			self.Auction[id].highestHASH = hash
			return(1)
		else:
			send(msg.sender, msg.value)
			return(0)
	
	def endAuction(id, key):
		if block.number > self.Auction[id].deadline:
			if sha3(key) == self.Auction[id].highestHASH:
				send(self.Auction[id].recipient, self.Auction[id].highestBid - thirdPartyFee)
				send(self.Auction[id].thirdParty, self.Auction[id].thirdPartyFee)
				self.clean(id)
				return(1)
			else:
				return(0)

	def notDelivered(id):
		if self.Auction[id].deliveryDeadline < block.number && msg.sender == self.Auction[id].highestBidder:
			send(self.Auction[id].highestBidder, self.Auction[id].highestBid)
			self.clean(id)
			return(1)
		else:
			return(0)

	def clean(id):
		if self == msg.sender:
			self.Auction[id].deadline = 0
			self.Auction[id].recipient = 0
			self.Auction[id].highestHASH = 0
			self.Auction[id].thirdParty = 0
			self.Auction[id].thirdPartyFee = 0
			self.Auction[id].deliveryDeadline = 0
			self.Auction[id].highestBid = 0
			self.Auction[id].highestBidder = 0

	So now we have a contract which is setup to handle real world transactions over time.

	Now take a look at the below two contracts:

	Contract 1:

	data secret
	data recipient

	def init():
		self.secret = 0xae1d270a3b5a89864b7076af168cd361760a5e413f4939c9f5d4abd3c6e10ce0
		self.recipient = msg.sender

	def Receive(key):
		if sha3(key) = self.secret:
			send(self.recipient, self.balance)
	
	Contract 2:	

	data secret
	data deliver

	def init():
		self.secret = 0xae1d270a3b5a89864b7076af168cd361760a5e413f4939c9f5d4abd3c6e10ce0
		self.deliver = msg.sender

	def send(key):
		if sha3(key) = self.secret:
			send(self.deliver, self.balance)


	These two contracts appear to execute the same code, however they are subtly different. They are in fact designed so that Bob and Alice can exchange Ether with one another, it works like this:

	Alice sends Contract 1 to the blockchain along with zero ether:

	Contract 1:

	data secret
	data recipient

	def init():
		self.secret = 0xae1d270a3b5a89864b7076af168cd361760a5e413f4939c9f5d4abd3c6e10ce0
		self.recipient = msg.sender # Alice's Address

	def Receive(key):
		if sha3(key) = self.secret:
			send(self.recipient, self.balance)

	Where self.secret is the hash of a secret value known only to Alice. Bob sees this contract on the blockchain and sends Contract 2 to the blockchain with zero ether - this also contains the secret known only to Alice. 

	Contract 2:	

	data secret
	data recipient

	def init():
		self.secret = 0xae1d270a3b5a89864b7076af168cd361760a5e413f4939c9f5d4abd3c6e10ce0
		self.recipient = msg.sender #Bob's address

	def send(key):
		if sha3(key) = self.secret:
			send(self.recipient, self.balance)

	Alice now sends 500 ether to Contract 2 and waits. Bob sees this and sends 500 ether to contract 1. Now because Alice is in possesion of the secret key she can send a transaction containing the key to contract 1, and have this contract send her the ether - In doing so she reveals her key which bob can then use in contract 2 to have the contract send him the ether.

	You might be wondering why we would use such a convoluted method to transfer ether between two parties when it would be much easier to use a contract - it is however a very important technique as it does not require the contracts be on the same  blockchain. This method could quite easily be modified to allow the transfer of other crypto currencies on other chains.
