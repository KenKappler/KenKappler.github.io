	Building on Ethereum has been designed to be extremely easy for web designers to pick up - with the languages being familiar enough for anyone with a knowledge of javascript to pick up very quickly.

	As such getting your development environment setup should be fairly simple for anyone who has designed a web page before.

	Firstly download the latest stable build of Alethzero, our CPP client, and install on your chosen operating system. During this early period of pre-release we recommend you install it on a virtual machine with vanilla ubuntu 14.04 installed. This will avoid any problems with package dependencies or other incompatibilities, and allow you to take snapshots and install develop builds onto your machine without fear of losing a stable client to fall back on. Build instructions are here:

	A text editor should be used for creating the backend contract code which we are going to write, for serpent I suggest you set your editor to treat serpent contracts saved with the '.se' suffix as python syntax and for solidity I suggest you save your files with a '.sol' suffix.

	A live refresh solution is *not* recommended when working on your html front-end, as we will be using asynchronous functions and testing they work correctly can be difficult without this enabled.
