	Thing's contract's kind of know
	
	Contracts live on the block chain - it is their home. You can send them information from the oustide world and they will interact with it but to a contract this information is not trustworthy.
	
	Fortunately the consensus mechanism provided by the ethereum blockchain provides contracts with some information that they can trust.
	
	The following
	
	tx.origin - the sender of the transaction
	tx.gas - gas remaining
	tx.gasprice - gas price of the transaction
	msg.sender - the sender of the message
	msg.value - the number of wei (smallest units of ether) sent with the message
	self - the contract's own address
	self.balance - the contract's balance
	x.balance (for any x) - that account's balance
	block.coinbase - current block miner's address
	block.timestamp - current block timestamp
	block.prevhash - previous block hash
	block.difficulty - current block difficulty
	block.number - current block number
	block.gaslimit - current block gaslimit
